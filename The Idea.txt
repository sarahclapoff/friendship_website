The Idea:

1. website.
	just a button and email address/form to submit pics

2. email/website form.
	email "send an email with photo of friends. in the body, write a ~150 word letter that explains the story of the photo. the entire body of the email will be displayed."

3. display random picture & story when button on website clicked.
	maybe also play music and show some cute hearts

4. other notes:
	- scan email & process images when button pressed.
	- save photos in the same way as astronomy. ie save photo and story with the same identifier, write txt doc of identifiers, and access them that way.


To Do:
1. make website
2. make email/photo organizing script
3.
